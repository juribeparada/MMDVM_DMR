This is just an experiment with G4KLX MMDVM firmware, with support for DMR mode only. This modified MMDVM firmware is intended to investigate CPU performance issues on Arduino Due or STM32F105 boards.

Please visit original Jonathan G4KLX's work for a complete MMDVM firmware with support for five modes (D-Star, DMR, YSF, P25 and NXDN): [MMDVM](https://github.com/g4klx/MMDVM).
